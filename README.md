# OS From the Perspective of Code rather than Theory.
- [Introduction](#introduction)

 In this Repo, I am trying to learn about Operating Systems from the perspective of code rather than theory. I will be implementing various Operating System concepts in C++ and Java. I will be using the following resources to learn about Operating Systems

 - [Main Objective](#main-objective)
    - To learn about Operating Systems from the perspective of code rather than theory.
    - To implement various Operating System concepts in C++ and Java.
    - To make some projects using the OS Concepts like File Encryptor and Decryptor, Web Server, etc.
    - To read the book Operating System Concepts by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne.

 - It wont be updated regularly. I will update it whenever I learn something new about Operating Systems.
